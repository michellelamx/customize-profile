# Linktree Frontend Assessment

## Part 1: The Profile
Build a React application that renders a Linktree-style profile from a JSON representation.

The data structure is up to you, but the profile(s) must include:
1. A profile image.
2. A username.
3. An optional bio (80 characters maximum).
4. Optional social icons with associated URLs.
5. A list of links, each with:
  -- A title (required)
  -- An image (optional)
6. **Optional Challenge**:

Support for grouping links into two layouts: the classic _list_ and _grid_.
Reference profiles: [linktr.ee/blackpink](linktr.ee/blackpink) and [linktr.ee/oliviarodrigo](https://linktr.ee/oliviarodrigo)

## Part 2: Customization
Your customers are asking for a fun and engaging way to customize the appearance of their profiles. Build a basic theming UI for the profile(s) that you have built in the previous step.

How you do this is up to you, some starting ideas may be to allow users to customize...
- Button color
- Button text color
- Page background color
- Button styles (eg rounded, square)

We are specifically providing no design guidance for this portion - this is your chance to impress us with some creative solutions.

Things to keep in mind:
- You cannot connect to a real world API - mock any data sets that you require.
- Consider re-usability through composition.
- Consider that profiles can be custom styled by each user.
- You are not expected to fully complete this challenge, so `@todo` comments are encouraged. How you design your solution and your ideas for the future are more important than functionality.
- Social icon assets have been included to save you some time.
- Imagine that this is shared repo and factor that into the development process.

## Submission
Set up your own git repository and make commits as you would in your day to day work.
Submit a link to your repo when you're finished in the take home assessment link provided in your email.

Best of luck!ðŸ”—ðŸŒ²
